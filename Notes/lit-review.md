### Wood, Daniel Alden: A Framework for Measuring Passenger-Experienced Transit Reliability Using Automated Data.
*Wood, Daniel Alden. “A Framework for Measuring Passenger-Experienced Transit Reliability Using Automated Data.” Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2015. http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/99539.*

Reliability traditionally measured from an operational/not customer perspective, differences: 
> 1. Operational reliability is based on timetable adherence, whereas passenger reliability is based on travel time variability.
> 2. Operational reliability is usually measured at the route or line-level, whereas passenger reliability is experienced at the origin-destination pair level.
> 3. Passenger reliability is experienced for the entire journey, but operational measures capture only portions of the journey.
